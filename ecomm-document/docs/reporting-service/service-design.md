**ecomm-reporting-service** documentation
-Version:**`1.0.0`**

## Scope

This document provides a structured architectural overview of the `reporting` microservice, detailing its configuration, data model, authorization logic, business rules, and API design. It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

* **Service architects** can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
* **Developers and maintainers** will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
* **Stakeholders and reviewers** can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.

> **Note for Frontend Developers**: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the [Service API Documentation](#) for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

> **Note for Backend Developers**: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.



## `Reporting` Service Settings [**Edit**](reporting/serviceSettings)

Aggregates business and sales analytics from orders and products. Provides report datasets for revenue, orders, and product performance and supports data exports (CSV/JSON).

### Service Overview

This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port `3004`, 
serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

* **API Test Interface (API Face):** `/`
* **Swagger Documentation:** `/swagger`
* **Postman Collection Download:** `/getPostmanCollection`
* **Health Checks:** `/health` and `/admin/health`
* **Current Session Info:** `/currentuser`
* **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico`

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `ecomm-reporting-service`.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

* **Preview:** `https://ecomm.prw.mindbricks.com/reporting-api`
* **Staging:** `https://ecomm-stage.mindbricks.co/reporting-api`
* **Production:** `https://ecomm.mindbricks.co/reporting-api`

                                 

### Authentication & Security
- **Login Required**: Yes

This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity.
If a crud route also is configured to require login, 
it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

  
### Service Data Objects
The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `ecomm-reporting-service`.

Data deletion is managed using a **soft delete** strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the `isActive` field to `false`.



| Object Name | Description | Public Access |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `salesReport` | Aggregated business/sales analytics snapshot for defined date range (on-demand for reporting/dashboard). | accessProtected | 
| `exportJob` | Tracks an export operation for orders or product catalog (for CSV/JSON download by admin). | accessProtected | 
| `reportingJobAudit` | (Optional: for extension) Audit log for reporting/export operations (who, when, what). Not exposed in CRUD for MVP. | accessProtected | 




## salesReport Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** Aggregated business/sales analytics snapshot for defined date range (on-demand for reporting/dashboard).

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
- **Soft Delete:** Disabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** accessProtected — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on API-level rules.








### Properties Schema

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `dateRange` | Object | Yes | Reporting interval: {start, end} Date fields. |
| `totalRevenue` | Double | Yes | Sum of totalAmount for paid/completed orders in range. |
| `orderCount` | Integer | Yes | Number of completed orders in the date range. |
| `productCount` | Integer | Yes | Unique products ordered in period (based on sold counts in orders). |
| `bestsellers` | Object | Yes | Array of bestseller products in range: {productId, productName, soldCount}. |
| `refundsTotal` | Double | Yes | Sum of all refunded order amounts (in minor unit) in date range. |
| `exportJobId` | ID | No | Optional link: the export job this report is attached to (if exported/snapshotted). |
* Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.


### Array Properties 

`bestsellers`

Array properties can hold multiple values and are indicated by the `[]` suffix in their type. Avoid using arrays in properties that are used for relations, as they will not work correctly.
Note that using connection objects instead of arrays is recommended for relations, as they provide better performance and flexibility.


### Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body.
Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any business API to set default values dynamically.

- **dateRange**: {}
- **totalRevenue**: 0.0
- **orderCount**: 0
- **productCount**: 0
- **bestsellers**: []
- **refundsTotal**: 0.0



### Auto Update Properties

`dateRange` `totalRevenue` `orderCount` `productCount` `bestsellers` `refundsTotal` `exportJobId`

An update crud API created with the option `Auto Params` enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. 
If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the `Allow Auto Update` option to false.
These properties will be added to the update API's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

 

 

 

### Elastic Search Indexing

`dateRange` `totalRevenue` `orderCount` `productCount` `refundsTotal`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. 
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.







### Relation Properties

`exportJobId`

Mindbricks supports relations between data objects, allowing you to define how objects are linked together.
You can define relations in the data object properties, which will be used to create foreign key constraints in the database.
For complex joins operations, Mindbricks supportsa BFF pattern, where you can view dynamic and static views based on Elastic Search Indexes.
Use db level relations for simple one-to-one or one-to-many relationships, and use BFF views for complex joins that require multiple data objects to be joined together.

- **exportJobId**: ID
Relation to `exportJob`.id

The target object is a sibling object, meaning that the relation is a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship from this object to the target.

On Delete: Set Null
Required: No









## exportJob Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** Tracks an export operation for orders or product catalog (for CSV/JSON download by admin).

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
- **Soft Delete:** Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** accessProtected — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on API-level rules.








### Properties Schema

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `exportType` | Enum | Yes | Export source: orders or products. |
| `status` | Enum | Yes | Export job status: pending, completed, failed. |
| `requestedBy` | ID | Yes | User/admin who requested this export job. |
| `startedAt` | Date | Yes | When export job was started. |
| `completedAt` | Date | No | When export job completed (null if not yet). |
| `downloadUrl` | String | No | URL to download exported file; set on completion. |
* Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.



### Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body.
Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any business API to set default values dynamically.

- **exportType**: orders
- **status**: pending
- **requestedBy**: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
- **startedAt**: new Date()


### Constant Properties

`exportType` `requestedBy` `startedAt`

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle.
A property is set to be constant if the `Allow Update` option is set to `false`.


### Auto Update Properties

`exportType` `status` `requestedBy` `startedAt` `completedAt` `downloadUrl`

An update crud API created with the option `Auto Params` enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. 
If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the `Allow Auto Update` option to false.
These properties will be added to the update API's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

 

### Enum Properties
Enum properties are defined with a set of allowed values, ensuring that only valid options can be assigned to them. 
The enum options value will be stored as strings in the database, 
but when a data object is created an addtional property with the same name plus an idx suffix will be created, which will hold the index of the selected enum option.
You can use the index property to sort by the enum value or when your enum options represent a sequence of values.

- **exportType**: [orders, products]

- **status**: [pending, completed, failed]

 

 

### Elastic Search Indexing

`exportType` `status` `requestedBy` `startedAt` `completedAt` `downloadUrl`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. 
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.







### Relation Properties

`requestedBy`

Mindbricks supports relations between data objects, allowing you to define how objects are linked together.
You can define relations in the data object properties, which will be used to create foreign key constraints in the database.
For complex joins operations, Mindbricks supportsa BFF pattern, where you can view dynamic and static views based on Elastic Search Indexes.
Use db level relations for simple one-to-one or one-to-many relationships, and use BFF views for complex joins that require multiple data objects to be joined together.

- **requestedBy**: ID
Relation to `user`.id

The target object is a sibling object, meaning that the relation is a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship from this object to the target.

On Delete: Set Null
Required: Yes


### Session Data Properties

`requestedBy`

Session data properties are used to store data that is specific to the user session, allowing for personalized experiences and temporary data storage.
If a property is configured as session data, it will be automatically mapped to the related field in the user session during CRUD operations.
Note that session data properties can not be mutated by the user, but only by the system.

- **requestedBy**: ID property will be mapped to the session parameter `userId`.

This property is also used to store the owner of the session data, allowing for ownership checks and access control.




### Formula Properties

`startedAt`

Formula properties are used to define calculated fields that derive their values from other properties or external data.
These properties are automatically calculated based on the defined formula and can be used for dynamic data retrieval.

- **startedAt**: Date  
  - Formula: `new Date().toISOString()`
  
  - Calculate After Instance: No
  






## reportingJobAudit Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** (Optional: for extension) Audit log for reporting/export operations (who, when, what). Not exposed in CRUD for MVP.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
